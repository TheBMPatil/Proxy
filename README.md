# Parenting on Autopilot 🍼💀

> "For the parents who didn't read the manual, are totally cooked, and just want to survive today."

## 📋 Project Overview
**Parenting on Autopilot** is a Gen-Z focused, mobile-first web application designed to stabilize overwhelmed Indian parents immediately. Unlike traditional parenting apps that feature stock photos of smiling families and long articles, this app embraces the chaos with a "Dark Mode, Minimal Text, Instant Dopamine" philosophy.

## 🚀 MVP Features

### 1. The "Cooked" Meter 🌡️
A gamified dashboard component that assesses user burnout levels.
- **Green (Chilled):** Standard app access.
- **Yellow (Managing):** Cautionary state.
- **Red (COOKED):** Triggers **SOS Mode**. Instantly hides clutter, reduces cognitive load, and focuses purely on survival instructions.

### 2. Sahara AI (SOS Chat) 🤖
A highly opinionated, Gemini-powered chatbot designed for crisis management.
- **Zero Fluff:** No "Hello, how are you." Straight to the point.
- **Structured Output:** Responses are strictly numbered lists (1, 2, 3) or bullet points using custom Markdown styling.
- **Indian Context:** Trained to suggest local remedies (Hing paste, Khichdi) and deflect unsolicited advice from relatives ("Mausi scripts").

### 3. The Reel Feed (Micro-Learning) 📱
A TikTok-style vertical scrolling feed for parenting hacks.
- **Snap Scrolling:** Addictive, easy one-thumb navigation.
- **Immersive UI:** Full-screen cards with simulated video backgrounds.
- **Doom-Scroll Protection:** Hard lock after 5 tips to prevent time-wasting.

### 4. The Vent Room 🕳️
A mental health feature allowing users to "scream into the void."
- **Validation:** The AI validates feelings without offering unwanted solutions.
- **Privacy:** No chat history stored; a transient space for emotional release.

### 5. The Village (Proxy Service) 👵
A mock marketplace for instant help.
- **Persona Selection:** Choose between professional "Nannies" or experienced "Dadis".
- **Translator:** A utility to translate instructions into Hindi for domestic help.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript (Vite)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Custom "Cyberpunk" Config)
- **AI Engine:** Google Gemini API (`gemini-3-flash-preview`)
- **Icons:** Native UTF-8 Emojis + CSS Shapes

### Design Decisions
- **Mobile-First Architecture:** Wrapped in a fixed `100dvh` container to mimic native app behavior on mobile browsers.
- **Cyberpunk Aesthetic:** High contrast Neon Green/Pink on Dark backgrounds to keep parents awake and engaged during 3 AM feeds.
- **Custom Markdown Renderer:** Transforms raw AI text into visually distinct, easy-to-read instructions (Neon bullets, Pink numbers).

## 🔮 Future Roadmap
- **Real-time Uber-style Nanny Tracking.**
- **Vernacular Audio Mode** (Hindi/Hinglish Voice Output).
- **Desi Diet Tracker** with pre-loaded Indian baby food charts.
